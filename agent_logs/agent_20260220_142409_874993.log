The composer.json scripts were already included in the last commit. The current working tree is clean with respect to the Temporal library source. 

All tasks are complete:

- **5210 tests passing** (1009 hand-written + 4201 data-driven from test262, 2 skipped)
- **0 mago errors** (lint + analyze)
- All 10 TC39 Temporal types fully implemented and immutable:
  - `PlainDate`, `PlainTime`, `PlainDateTime`, `Duration`, `Instant`
  - `ZonedDateTime`, `TimeZone`, `Calendar`
  - `PlainYearMonth`, `PlainMonthDay`
  - `Temporal\Now` utility class
- Complete typed exception hierarchy under `Temporal\Exception\`
- test262 data extraction pipeline with 44 fixture files from TC39 reference tests

The `PROGRESS.md` already records the final completed state. Stopping as the stopping condition has been met.
