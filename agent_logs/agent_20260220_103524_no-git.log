Done. Here's a summary of what was completed:

## Completed: PlainDate

**Files created:**
- `phpunit.xml` — PHPUnit 11 configuration
- `src/PlainDate.php` — Full implementation including:
  - Constructor with validation (month 1–12, day 1–N per month, leap year aware)
  - `from()` static constructor (accepts ISO string, array, or PlainDate)
  - `fromEpochDays()` / `toEpochDays()` using Hinnant's civil-calendar algorithm
  - Computed properties: `dayOfWeek` (Mon=1…Sun=7), `dayOfYear`, `weekOfYear`, `daysInMonth`, `daysInYear`, `inLeapYear`
  - `add()` / `subtract()` with year/month/week/day fields
  - `with()` for field overrides (immutable)
  - `until()` / `since()` returning a `Duration`
  - `compare()` / `equals()`
  - `__toString()` with extended ISO 8601 year format
- `src/Duration.php` — Minimal stub needed by `PlainDate::until()`/`since()`
- `tests/PlainDateTest.php` — 57 tests, 108 assertions, all passing

**Next task:** `PlainTime` (hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond, nanosecond)
