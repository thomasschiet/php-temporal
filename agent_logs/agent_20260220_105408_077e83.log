`Duration` is fully implemented and committed. Here's a summary of what was done:

**`src/Duration.php`** — full implementation replacing the stub:
- Constructor validates all non-zero fields share the same sign (throws `InvalidArgumentException` on mixed signs)
- Computed readonly properties: `sign` (-1/0/1) and `blank`
- `from()` — accepts `Duration`, `array`, or ISO 8601 string (`-P1Y2M3W4DT5H6M7S`, fractional seconds up to 9 digits)
- `negated()`, `abs()`, `with()` — immutable transformations
- `add()`, `subtract()` — field-by-field arithmetic
- `compare()` — static comparison via nanosecond totals (weeks & days use fixed 7-day/24-hour conversions)
- `total(unit)` — convert to a float in the given unit (nanoseconds through weeks)
- `round(unit)` — half-expand rounding to a given smallest unit
- `__toString()` — ISO 8601 with sub-second decimal fractions and leading `-` for negative durations

**`tests/DurationTest.php`** — 77 tests covering all methods, edge cases, and immutability.

Total test suite: **277 tests, all passing**.
