All done. Here's a summary of what was completed this session:

**Fixed 23 mago static analysis errors** (`possibly-invalid-argument`) across 9 source files:

- Widened PHPDoc `@param` array types from strict shapes (e.g. `array{'year': int, 'month': int}`) to `array<string, mixed>` on factory/utility methods that validate their inputs at runtime
- Added `(int)`/`(string)` casts where needed when extracting values from the widened types
- Applied to: `PlainYearMonth`, `PlainMonthDay`, `Calendar`, `PlainTime`, `PlainDateTime`, `PlainDate`, `Instant`, `ZonedDateTime`, `Duration`

**Final state:**
- 1008 tests, 1895 assertions — all passing
- `mago fmt` — clean
- `mago lint` — 0 errors (70 warnings/notes/helps)
- `mago analyze` — 0 errors (81 warnings/helps)

The project is complete. All TC39 Temporal types are implemented and the codebase passes all quality checks.
