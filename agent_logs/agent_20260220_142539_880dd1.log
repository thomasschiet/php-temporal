All tasks are complete. The project is in a fully working state:

- **1009 hand-written tests** passing (Temporal suite)
- **4201 test262 data-driven tests** passing, 2 skipped
- **0 mago errors** (133 warnings/helps, which is expected for a test-heavy project)

The PROGRESS.md already documents that all planned tasks are complete. The implementation covers the full TC39 Temporal API surface:

- `PlainDate`, `PlainTime`, `PlainDateTime`
- `Duration`, `Instant`
- `ZonedDateTime`, `TimeZone`, `Calendar`
- `PlainYearMonth`, `PlainMonthDay`
- ISO 8601 parsing, `Temporal\Now` utility
- Typed exception hierarchy under `Temporal\Exception\`
- test262 data extraction pipeline with 4202 data-driven tests

**Stopping — all planned tasks are complete.**
