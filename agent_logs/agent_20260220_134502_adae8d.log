All planned tasks are complete and the project is in good shape:

- **1008 tests passing** (1895 assertions)
- **0 mago errors** (only warnings/notes/helps — no blocking issues)
- **Complete TC39 Temporal API surface area** implemented across 11 source classes

The PROGRESS.md already records "All planned tasks complete" with "Next Tasks: None". The implementation covers all required types:

- `PlainDate`, `PlainTime`, `PlainDateTime`
- `Duration`, `Instant`
- `ZonedDateTime`, `TimeZone`, `Calendar`
- `PlainYearMonth`, `PlainMonthDay`
- ISO 8601 parsing for all types
- `Temporal\Now` utility class

All classes are immutable, test262 behaviors are covered in the PHPUnit suite, and mago passes with 0 errors. **The project is complete — stopping now.**
