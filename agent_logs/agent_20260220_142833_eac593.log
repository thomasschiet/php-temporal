All tests are passing. The project is in excellent shape:

- **Temporal suite**: 1009 tests, 1897 assertions — all passing
- **test262 suite**: 4201 tests, 9411 assertions — 4199 passing, 2 skipped (known polyfill precision edge cases)
- **mago**: 0 errors (only warnings, which were expected)

The PROGRESS.md correctly reflects the completed state. This is a complete implementation of the PHP Temporal library with:

- All 10 TC39 Temporal types implemented (`PlainDate`, `PlainTime`, `PlainDateTime`, `Duration`, `Instant`, `ZonedDateTime`, `TimeZone`, `Calendar`, `PlainYearMonth`, `PlainMonthDay`)
- `Temporal\Now` utility class
- Full ISO 8601 parsing
- Typed exception hierarchy under `Temporal\Exception\`
- 5210 total tests (1008 hand-written + 4201 data-driven from test262)
- Zero mago errors

**All planned tasks are complete — stopping as instructed.**
