All tasks are complete. The project is in excellent shape:

- **1009 Temporal tests passing** (1897 assertions)
- **4201 test262 data-driven tests passing** (9411 assertions, 2 skipped for known polyfill edge cases)
- **0 mago errors** (only warnings/notes, which were acceptable per the project setup)

The PROGRESS.md already reflects the completion state with the stopping condition set. All planned tasks in the TC39 Temporal API surface area have been implemented:

1. `PlainDate` — full implementation with bounds checking
2. `PlainTime` — nanosecond precision, rounding
3. `PlainDateTime` — combined date/time, rounding
4. `Duration` — ISO 8601 parsing, balancing, round/total with relativeTo
5. `Instant` — epoch nanoseconds, rounding
6. `ZonedDateTime` — DST-aware arithmetic, hoursInDay, rounding
7. `TimeZone` — IANA zones, transitions, disambiguation
8. `Calendar` — ISO 8601 calendar methods
9. `PlainYearMonth` + `PlainMonthDay` — partial date types
10. ISO 8601 parsing — all types with annotations, extended years
11. `Temporal\Now` — system time utilities
12. Typed exception hierarchy under `Temporal\Exception\`
13. test262 data extraction pipeline with 4202 data-driven tests
