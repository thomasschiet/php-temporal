All tasks are complete. The implementation is in a fully working state:

- **1008 tests passing** (1895 assertions)
- **0 mago errors** (81 warnings/helps, no errors)
- All TC39 Temporal API types implemented: `PlainDate`, `PlainTime`, `PlainDateTime`, `Duration`, `Instant`, `ZonedDateTime`, `TimeZone`, `Calendar`, `PlainYearMonth`, `PlainMonthDay`, and the `Temporal\Now` utility class

The PROGRESS.md already reflects this completed state. No further work is needed — stopping as instructed.
