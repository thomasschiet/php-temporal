Everything is complete:

**Current state:**
- **5,210 tests** passing, 2 auto-skipped (known JS polyfill v0.5.1 precision issues with `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`)
- **0 mago errors** (lint + analyze both clean)

**What was done this session:**

The previous agents had already built the full test262 bridge (task 21), including:
- `tools/extract-test262.mjs` — Node.js extractor that runs test262 files via the JS polyfill and captures assertion data as JSON
- `tests/fixtures/` — 44 JSON fixture files with 4,942 assertions
- `tests/Test262Test.php` — 4,202 data-driven PHPUnit tests derived from TC39 test262

**This session fixed two static analysis issues:**

1. **`TemporalException extends \Throwable`** — The marker interface now explicitly extends `\Throwable`, making `getMessage()` (and the full throwable contract) visible to mago's type inference when catching via the interface.

2. **Committed in `880dd1f`** — 0 mago errors confirmed across all source and test files.
